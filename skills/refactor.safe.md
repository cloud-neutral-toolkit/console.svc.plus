# Skill: Safe Refactor

## When to Use

- Simplifying existing logic
- Reducing duplication
- Renaming symbols without behavior changes

## Steps

1. Confirm no behavior change is intended.
2. Refactor in small, reversible steps.
3. Keep interfaces stable unless instructed.
4. Run minimal verification (see mcp/testing.md).

## Do Not

- Do not mix refactors with feature changes.
- Do not reformat unrelated code.
